Using Eclipse write a java program as follows:

The program asks for a class name. The user provides a name

The program checks that the class is an implementation of an interface that we call IntegerSumInterface, which provides a method sum which takes two integer arguments and returns their sum as an integer value.

If it is not, then it prints an appropriate error notification and exits.

If it is, then it creates an instance of the class, and call the Sum method to confirm that it does what expected.

Everything must be traced on the console output
